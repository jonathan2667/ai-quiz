   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-quiz
   ```

2. **Start a Local Server**
   
   **Option A: Using Python (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   
   **Option B: Using Node.js (if you have it installed)**
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```
   
   **Option C: Using PHP (if available)**
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Access the Application**
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Alternative Setup
You can also serve the files using any web server of your choice. The application consists of static files and doesn't require any backend setup.
